2. **Futre**: Navigation bar overlap with header and content

---

## 1. The Vintage Flair Case Study - Video Fixes

### Problem
- 4 videos were supposed to be embedded but weren't showing up with proper video controls
- 2 videos were in `.mov` format which browsers don't support well
- Videos appeared as static images instead of playable video players

### Solution
1. **Converted video formats**:
   - `ddcb4968680a4942ab5a194a7a359e91.mov` → `.mp4`
   - `3458b59c-8bb5-4804-93e4-67a003afdac3.mov` → `.mp4`
   - Used `ffmpeg` for conversion

2. **Added HTML5 video section**:
   - Created "📹 Crafting Process Videos" section
   - Embedded 4 videos in a responsive grid layout
   - Added proper video controls (play, pause, volume, fullscreen)
   - Styled with rounded corners and shadows

3. **Video details**:
   - **Video 1**: Journal Showcase (0:22 duration) - `.MP4` ✓
   - **Video 2**: Handcrafted Details (0:55 duration) - `.MP4` ✓
   - **Video 3**: Page Design Process - `.mp4` (converted) ✓
   - **Video 4**: Final Product - `.mp4` (converted) ✓

## 2. Futre Case Study - Navigation Fixes

### Problem
- Sidebar navigation was overlapping with the header section
- Sidebar navigation was overlapping with the TL;DR content box
- Navigation was hidden on screens less than 1400px wide (too restrictive)

### Solution
1. **Fixed navigation positioning**:
   - Changed from `top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);` to `top: 150px;`
   - This positions the sidebar below the header without overlap
   - Added `max-height: calc(100vh - 180px)` for scroll support
   - Added `overflow-y: auto` for long navigation lists

2. **Adjusted responsive breakpoint**:
   - Changed media query from `@media (max-width: 1400px)` to `@media (max-width: 1024px)`
   - Sidebar now stays visible on most desktop screens
   - Only hides on tablets and mobile devices

### Files Modified
- `/home/ubuntu/portfolio_redesigned/futre_case_study.html`
  - Lines 178-190: Updated `.side-navigation` positioning
  - Line 493: Changed media query breakpoint

### Result
- ✅ Navigation visible on desktop screens
- ✅ No overlap with header
- ✅ No overlap with TL;DR section
- ✅ Smooth scrolling for long navigation lists
- ✅ Proper responsive behavior

    <video controls style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);">
        <source src="..." type="video/mp4">
    </video>
</div>
```

**Futre** - Fixed navigation positioning:
```css
.side-navigation {
    position: fixed;
    left: 2rem;
    top: 150px;  /* Changed from: top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%); */
    max-height: calc(100vh - 180px);
    overflow-y: auto;
}

@media (max-width: 1024px) {  /* Changed from: 1400px */
